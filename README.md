# 💡 Project Idea

This project simulates an interactive coffee shop assistant. Users can speak naturally (e.g., “I want a cappuccino”), and the assistant listens, understands, and responds with the appropriate answer—spoken and written—based on a built-in FAQ-style database.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Open the project folder.
2. Launch `coffee.html` in your browser 
3. Click the 🎙️ "Tap to Speak" button.
4. Speak clearly into your microphone.
5. The browser will transcribe your request and reply with a relevant answer via speech and text.
